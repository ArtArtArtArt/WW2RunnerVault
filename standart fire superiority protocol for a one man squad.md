This is a protocol of how to act when a contact with an enemy is initiated.

- Soldier starts shooting the enemy and tries to achive a [[fire superiority]]
- If it is achived he may try to advance (if he is in attack order) or stop shooting (if he is defending). He also might not stop shooting immediately due to his [[personality]].
- If soldier is loosing [[fire superiority]] then he tries to find cover and retreat. If fire superiority is extremely lost then he is [[pinned down]] and cannot move.
