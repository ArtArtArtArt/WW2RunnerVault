# Fire superiority
#combat
## Simple explanation
Is a state during [[the combat]] when an enemy cannot shoot at a friendly squad due to the amount of fire he is recieving. It can be achived using small arms, artillery or any support.
It is adviced to achive it before any maneuver.
Without firesuperiority movement will lead to extreme casualties.

## Definition
FIre superiority is a state of a squad that may be achived during firearm [[the combat|combat]]. The squad tries to fire as many bullets as possible at the enemy from some cover until the enemy is no longer capable of making an answering fire. This may happen due to phisical destruction of an enemy or due to them losing their morale to return fire. 
Most of the time if enemy squad loses morale to return fire faster then friendly, then this friendly squad gains **fire superiority**. Under this conditions the squad may start making maneuvers.
*If fire superiority is provided by another squad then maneuvers are enabled also.???*

Fire superiority is achived when squad sees that all the enemies it has detected are pined by fire.

*How to destinquish fire superiority from an ambush?*

So the enemy might deliberately stop firing in order for the you to come closer.
That is why you should have a number of criteria that shows that superiority is won.
So the conditions are:
 - The squad is not recieving fire damage
 - All enemy positions [[ squad recon information|that they know of]] are covered by fire. Enenmy firing in another direction might give reduced amount of firesuperiority too.


Fire superiority might not be won 100 percent. But maneuvers may still be performed. This only requires high morale and cohesion of the squad (**more time soldiers spend with each other, more cohesion they have**).

Also under the direct order and during an [[operation]] maneuvers might be done even without all these conditions.

## Formula
#todo this formule should be reworked
So the for this is the following:
***(friendly [[morale damage]] - enemy [[morale damage]]) / 2 + (enemy [[morale damage]] at other entities / 2)***
