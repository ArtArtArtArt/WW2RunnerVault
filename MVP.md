# MVP
## The first milestone user story
The player is playing as a main commander. He sends one soldier to the position on the fronline. This soldier goes there and is doing nothing (**[[Second Milestone#^1|potentially he suffers from hunger and goes to sleep]]**). If [[Soldier encounters an enemy]] he tries to win fire superiority. If he mamages to do so - the enemy is running away. If he does not he tries to run back to commander (last known location) (**[[Second Milestone#^2|potentially he is moving using the best cover]]**).  The soldier uses [[standart fire superiority protocol for a one man squad]].
